      <p>My name is Jonathan Tsai. Feel free to just call me Jon. I've graduated from the University of Washington with
        a degree in Chemistry. Ending up working in ad operations for the past 10 years at. My job mostly consists of
        planning the clients' marketing objective with display ads, which typically include targeting strategies and
        developing test plans to optimize their campaigns. But in the end, the work became monotonous and stressful,
        which led to me trying to automate a lot of my processes through coding. My goal here at Code Fellows is to
        transition out of this advertising industry and start developing to solve actual problems through coding.</p>
